# Discussions

This reading group serves as a location to discuss the applications of the blockchain, starting with the most well-known - crypotocurrency.

## Motivations
Why do we build decentralized technologies? How do we predict what will be successful, what will get shutdown, and what will end up as a science experiment that no one uses in practice?

As an engineer, it seems that:
- (A) trustless computation &
- (B) a public, trustless, immutable database

are revolutionary primitives that will unlock amazing things we haven't seen before. However, I believe in a similar vain to @devonzuegel,

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"> I&#39;ve yet to see a compelling blockchain application that isn&#39;t self-referential back into the crypto ecosystem. and I&#39;ve been looking pretty enthusiastically! I expected to see at least *one* by now</p>&mdash; Devon ☀️ (@devonzuegel) <a href="https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1462854294315614217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I'm open-minded and hopeful that non-self-referential applications of crypto can and will exist, hence why I have started this reading group. I'm just surprised and disappointed that I haven't seen them yet. Maybe I'm just being impatient!
