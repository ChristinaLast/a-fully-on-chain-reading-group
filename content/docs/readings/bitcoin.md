# Bitcoin

###### tags: `bitcoin` `12/21`

In this on-chain reading session we're going to read the first formalisation of Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto.

We’ll talk about the formal definition of trustless computing and hash-based proof-of-work, and how nodes contribute to the network on a best effort basis.

We’ll ask:
- What is trustless computing?
- How does a hash-based proof-of-work method work?
- What measures the best effort basis of a node?

Come join us and debate…
